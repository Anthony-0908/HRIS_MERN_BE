It's great that you're thinking about how to structure your system development! Planning out your week with specific tasks like "Monday: Backend, Tuesday: Frontend" is a good start, but here's a breakdown of how to refine that approach for better results:

Why a Strict Day-by-Day Breakdown Can Be Tricky

Dependencies: Software development rarely flows in a perfectly linear way. Frontend work often depends on having at least some backend functionality in place. Sticking rigidly to a "backend then frontend" schedule might lead to delays if the backend takes longer than expected.
Context Switching: Constantly switching between different parts of the system can be inefficient. It takes time to get your head into the specific mindset and details of each area.
Flexibility: Unexpected issues or changes in requirements can arise. A rigid schedule makes it harder to adapt.   
A More Effective Approach

Prioritize Tasks, Not Days:

Identify Core Features: What are the absolute must-haves for your system to be functional? Focus on these first.
Break Down Tasks: Divide large tasks (like "build the entire backend") into smaller, more manageable chunks (e.g., "design the database schema," "implement user authentication").   
Prioritize by Dependency: Figure out which tasks need to be completed before others can begin.
Create a Flexible Schedule:

Use a Project Management Tool: Tools like Trello, Asana, or Jira can help you organize tasks, assign them, and track progress.   
Set Milestones: Define key points in your development process (e.g., "user authentication complete," "basic UI implemented").
Timeboxing: Allocate a reasonable amount of time for each task, but be prepared to adjust if needed.
Regular Reviews: At the end of each week (or even a couple of times a week), review your progress, identify any roadblocks, and adjust your plan for the following week.   
Embrace Iteration:

Don't Aim for Perfection: It's often better to build a basic version of a feature quickly, test it, get feedback, and then refine it.
Testing is Key: Regularly test your code to catch bugs early.   
Be Prepared to Change: Software development is an iterative process. You might need to adjust your design or approach as you learn more.   
Example Workflow

Instead of:

Monday: Backend
Tuesday: Frontend
Wednesday: Testing
Try something like:

Week 1:
Goal: Implement user authentication
Tasks:
Design database schema for users
Implement user registration API
Create login form on the frontend
Write unit tests for backend code
Week 2:
Goal: Develop core data models
Tasks:
Define data structures for key entities
Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for these entities
Create basic UI for displaying data
Key Takeaways

Flexibility and iteration are crucial in software development.   
Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and importance, not just days of the week.
Use project management tools to stay organized and track progress.   
Regularly review your progress and adjust your plan as needed.
By following these principles, you'll be well on your way to developing a successful system!
